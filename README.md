# Mechanical-Turk
The project involves creating an automated chess system inspired by the legendary "Mechanical Turk". This system allows a human user to play chess against a machine, which not only calculates and executes moves on the board but also interacts emotionally through a robotic face. The objective of the project is to combine advanced computer vision, robotics, and programming techniques to offer a unique and interactive gameplay experience.

## Description

**Project Components**
The project consists of several key components that work together to create a cohesive and smooth experience:

**1. Interactive Chessboard**
**· Board**: A standard chessboard with magnetic pieces.
**· Camera**: A camera mounted above the board or into the robotic face to capture images and detect piece movements.

**2. Computer Vision System** 
**· Piece Detection**: Uses computer vision techniques to recognize and track the pieces on the board.
**· Movement Recognition**: Detects and records the user's moves by comparing the current state of the board with a reference image.

**3. Piece Movement Mechanism**
**· Axis System**: X-Y axes equipped with stepper motors that control an electromagnet to move the pieces on the board.
**· Electromagnet**: Placed under the board, this device lifts and moves the pieces to the desired position.

**4. Chess Control Software**
**· Chess Engine**: Uses Stockfish, one of the most advanced chess engines, to calculate the machine's moves.
**· Control Interface**: A Python program that coordinates communication between the chess engine, the vision system, and the motor controller.

**5. Interactive Robotic Face**
**· LCD Screen**: Displays different facial expressions in response to the state of the game.
**· Gestures and Expressions**: Programmed gestures and facial expressions to reflect emotions like happiness, surprise, or frustration, depending on the game's progress.
